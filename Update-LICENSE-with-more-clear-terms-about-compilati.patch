+Open GApps installable zip exception
+
+This Open GApps GPLv3 licensed scripts exception ("Exception") is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3").
+It applies to a given file (the "GPLv3 licensed scripts") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
+
+When you use Open GApps to compile an Open GApps installable zip, Open GApps combines portions of GPLv3 licensed scripts in this zip.
+The purpose of this Exception is to allow generation of non-GPL zips, in this way, these scripts are covered by this Exception.
+
+0. Definitions.
+A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the GPLv3 licensed scripts for execution or installation after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the GPLv3 licensed scripts, but is not otherwise based on these GPLv3 scripts.
+
+"Open GApps" means a version of The Open GApps Project, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.
+
+"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with Open GApps in accord with the license of Open GApps.
+
+"Installable zip" refers to output from any scripts that can be executed on Android compatible devices. Notwithstanding that, "Installable zip" does not include data in any format that is used as an intermediate representation, or used for producing an intermediate representation.
+
+The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, into an Installable Zip.
+
+A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using Open GApps, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on Open GApps. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any Open GApps intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.
+
+1. Grant of Additional Permission.
+You have permission to propagate a work of installable zip formed by combining the GPLv3 licensed scripts with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all in the installable zip was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
+
+2. Applicability of GPLv3 copyleft is retained on the GPLv3 licensed scripts.
+Any file within the installable zip that is part of the GPLv3 licensed scripts, is in itself still licensed as GPLv3 and retains its copyleft permissions. It is to be treated as an "aggregate" as specified in the GPLv3.
+
+3. No Weakening of Open GApps Copyleft.
+The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of Open GApps.
+
